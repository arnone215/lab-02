    <main>
        <p id="zero-paragraph">Class 2 Lab</p>
        <p id="first-paragraph"> My name is Thomas Arnone. I am currently a student at CodeFellows Seattle. Born and raised in New York, then upon completion of my time served as a United States Army Infantryman, I decided to stay in WA.</p>
        <p id="second-paragraph"> I have always had a love for computers, as well as technology in general. I had built my first PC when I was 13 years old after becoming obsessed with Massive Multiplayer Online games and constantly stayed up to date with the newest hardware to reach optimum performance and graphics for my PC.</p>
        <p id="third-paragraph"> The past two or three years I have procrastinated very much about starting my journey into the Tech Industry. A few of my close friends currently work in tech and have been getting on me about starting a coding bootcamp, but was always struggling to find enough time in my schedule to make it work, and attend classes at night. Someday down the road I would love to work in tech with a focus on ML(machine learning) or AI(artificial intelligence), that is very far into the future, but is most definitely a goal of mine.</p>
        <p id="fourth-paragraph"> In my free time, I enjoy exploring my great state of Washington as much as I am able to. Pretty cliche to say but I like hiking in the North Cascades. If the weather is too rough, I can still stay occupied by catching up on some of my favorite TV shows or playing some video games on Xbox Live. Regardless of what weather the PNW throws at us, I am always on a mission to try new places to eat or have a couple drinks. I have spent some time cooking in kitchens and have always been a foodie!</p>
